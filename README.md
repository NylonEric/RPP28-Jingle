## Lyrics
> There once was a ship that put to sea  
> And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea  
> The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down  
> Blow, me bully boys, blow (huh)  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> She had not been two weeks from shore  
> When down on her a right whale bore  
> The captain called all hands and swore  
> He'd take that whale in tow (huh)  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> Before the boat had hit the water  
> The whale's tail came up and caught her  
> All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her  
> When she dived down below (huh)  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> No line was cut, no whale was freed  
> An' the captain's mind was not on greed  
> But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed  
> She took that ship in tow (huh)  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> For forty days or even more (ooh)  
> The line went slack then tight once more  
> All boats were lost, there were only four  
> And still that whale did go  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> As far as I've heard, the fight's still on  
> The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone  
> The Wellerman makes his regular call  
> To encourage the captain, crew and all  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go  

> Soon may the Wellerman come  
> To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
> One day, when the tonguing' is done  
> We'll take our leave and go
