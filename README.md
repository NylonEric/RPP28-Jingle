## Lyrics
|Original Lyrics | Replacement Lyrics|
|--------------------------- | ---------------------------|
|There once was a ship that put to sea<br>And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea<br>The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down<br>Blow, me bully boys, blow (huh)|There once was a class, a sight to see<br>The twenty eight cohort RPP<br>The sprints were hard, some got them down<br>'tis story time, gather 'round|
|She had not been two weeks from shore<br>When down on her a right whale bore<br>The captain called all hands and swore<br>He'd take that whale in tow (huh)|We used to be called RPT<br>Now we represent RPP<br>Check out our rhymes, those west coast times!<br>Just wait and you will see!|
|Soon may the Wellerman come<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>One day, when the tonguing' is done<br>We'll take our leave and go|LinkedIn decides our fate<br>Kitchen time, don't be late!<br>Push code, verbose mode<br>We're cohort twenty eight!|
|Before the boat had hit the water<br>The whale's tail came up and caught her<br>All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br>When she dived down below (huh)|Before our lives had been such bores<br>We saw the ad and then explored<br>Precourse came, opened the door<br>To worlds of so much mo'<br>|
|She had not been two weeks from shore<br>When down on her a right whale bore<br>The captain called all hands and swore<br>He'd take that whale in tow (huh)|Careers we wanted to uplift<br>We went and turned to Javascript<br>You can tell now by our code<br>We love our ECMA6|
|Soon may the Wellerman come<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>One day, when the tonguing' is done<br>We'll take our leave and go|LinkedIn decides our fate<br>Kitchen time, don't be late!<br>Push code, verbose mode<br>We're cohort twenty eight!|
|No line was cut, no whale was freed<br>An' the captain's mind was not on greed<br>But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed<br>She took that ship in tow (huh)|We come from near and far and wide<br>Different jobs and homes reside<br>Recursively, coding OOP<br>Forgot git push and cried!|
|For forty days or even more (ooh)<br>The line went slack then tight once more<br>All boats were lost, there were only four<br>And still that whale did go|We had not been two days in sprint<br>Endless complaints from ES Lint<br>Tech Mentor called all hands and told<br>Code, fix, pull request code|
|Soon may the Wellerman come<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>One day, when the tonguing' is done<br>We'll take our leave and go|LinkedIn decides our fate<br>Kitchen time, don't be late!<br>Push code, verbose mode<br>We're cohort twenty eight!|
|Soon may the Wellerman come<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>One day, when the tonguing' is done<br>We'll take our leave and go|LinkedIn decides our fate<br>Kitchen time, don't be late!<br>Push code, verbose mode<br>We're cohort twenty eight, Huh!|
