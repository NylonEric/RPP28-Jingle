Used to be RPT
now we represent RPP

check out our rhymes
those west coast times

just wait and you will see


we come from far and wide
different jobs and homes reside

recursively
Coding OOP

forget to git push? you have cried


The sprints, past us they have whirled,
our skills grow and unfurled

execution closure
pass arguments? oh sure

A whole new world

our class is constructed
best you've e'r instructed

back off, bugs
time to meow, send hugs

test assert and pray with any luck, they said

LinkedIn decides our fate
Kitchen time, don't be late

learn to code
flag for verbose mode

we're cohort 28
